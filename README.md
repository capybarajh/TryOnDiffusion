## Environment

The code was developed and tested on the following environment:

* Operating System: Windows server 2019

* Python Version: Python 3.10

* GPU : NVIDIA Tesla T4 16GB

* CUDA 11.8



## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository
To get started with training examples, first clone this repository by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mutoy-choi/Tryondiffusion


cd Tryondiffusion
```
This will clone the repository and navigate you into the project directory.

### Set Up Virtual Environment

```
python -m venv venv

.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

These commands create and activate a virtual environment named venv. This isolates the project dependencies, making it easier to manage.

### Install Dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the Example Training code

```
python one_shot_test_ParallelUnet.py
```

This file allows you to know if the model is working well or not using example data for ParallelUnet(From 128x128 to 256*256)

## Further upload
* update dataset using VITON-HD dataset
